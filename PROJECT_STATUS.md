# MTA DETENI — Project Status

**Version:** P10.40 Final Pre-Governance Release Manifest  
**Branch:** `phase10.14-database-verification-package`  
**Certification:** NOT CERTIFIED  
**Migration Freeze:** TRUE  
**AI:** OFF  
**Data Boundary:** SYNTHETIC ONLY

## Completed checkpoints

P9 kernel foundations; P10.1–P10.13 operational/domain/database-contract foundations; P10.14–P10.17 controlled database verification packages; P10.18–P10.21 document-output operationalization and runtime integration contracts; P10.22–P10.24 CI evidence, release-readiness and safety consolidation; P10.25–P10.34 runtime, authorization, document API, audit, transaction and security certification-readiness contracts; P10.35 release-candidate hardening; P10.36 operational scenario and failure-injection matrix; P10.37 evidence decision record; P10.38 production-readiness traceability; P10.39 final pre-governance gate; P10.40 final pre-governance release manifest.

## Integrated architecture

HTTP request → authentication → server-side authorization → scope/duty/classification/SoD → validation → domain command → critical transaction → audit/outbox → commit → post-commit provider. Document generation is deterministic and bound to immutable template/version/hash. Artifact download is protected by a persistent actor/scope/object/expiry-bound single-use grant. Administrative RBAC authority remains separate from operational authority.

## Current decision

**BLOCKED FOR PRODUCTION / REVIEW PACKAGE PREPARED.** The application has a consolidated pre-governance contract, but this is not production certification.

## Production blockers

- independently observable GitHub Actions step-level evidence;
- explicit governance approval to lift Migration Freeze;
- controlled PostgreSQL migration/schema verification;
- final actor-to-identity and scope RLS policy;
- real PostgreSQL isolation/concurrency evidence;
- persistent grant integration against deployed schema;
- persistent audit/outbox evidence;
- private storage/provider security;
- deployed HTTP authentication/RBAC enforcement;
- approved production DOCX templates/signature infrastructure;
- WhatsApp provider/webhook verification;
- scanner/device integration;
- monitoring, backup/restore and disaster-recovery evidence;
- provider retry/dead-letter/idempotency evidence.

## Safety rules

- no schema migration;
- no production database operation;
- no real detainee data;
- no production credentials or secrets;
- AI remains OFF;
- synthetic fixtures/test doubles only;
- certification remains fail-closed.

## Governance boundary

The next action is a governance decision, not an automatic technical activation: whether Migration Freeze may be lifted under controlled procedure. Until that decision exists, the database remains untouched and all production activation paths remain blocked.
