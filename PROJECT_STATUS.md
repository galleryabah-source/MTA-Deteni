**Data Boundary:** SYNTHETIC ONLY

## Completed checkpoints

P9 kernel foundations; P10.1–P10.13 operational/domain/database-contract foundations; P10.14–P10.17 controlled database verification packages; P10.18–P10.21 document-output operationalization and runtime integration contracts; P10.22–P10.24 CI evidence, release-readiness and safety consolidation; P10.25–P10.34 runtime, authorization, document API, audit, transaction and security certification-readiness contracts; P10.35 release-candidate hardening; P10.36 operational scenario and failure-injection matrix; P10.37 evidence decision record; P10.38 production-readiness traceability; P10.39 final pre-governance gate; P10.40 final pre-governance release manifest; P10.41 controlled governance decision packet; P10.42 controlled PostgreSQL/RLS execution runbook; P10.43 post-freeze verification evidence contract; P10.44 production cutover/rollback gate.

## Integrated architecture

HTTP request → authentication → server-side authorization → scope/duty/classification/SoD → validation → domain command → critical transaction → audit/outbox → commit → post-commit provider. Document generation is deterministic and bound to immutable template/version/hash. Artifact download is protected by a persistent actor/scope/object/expiry-bound single-use grant. Administrative RBAC authority remains separate from operational authority.

## Current decision

**BLOCKED FOR PRODUCTION / GOVERNANCE DECISION REQUIRED.** The implementation path now has a controlled pre-freeze review package, execution runbook, post-freeze evidence contract, and cutover/rollback gate. These do not constitute production certification.

## Production blockers

- independently observable GitHub Actions step-level evidence;
- explicit governance approval to lift Migration Freeze;
- controlled PostgreSQL migration/schema verification;
- final actor-to-identity and scope RLS policy;
- real PostgreSQL isolation/concurrency evidence;
- persistent grant integration against deployed schema;
- persistent audit/outbox evidence;
- private storage/provider security;
- deployed HTTP authentication/RBAC enforcement;
- approved production DOCX templates/signature infrastructure;
- WhatsApp provider/webhook verification;
- scanner/device integration;
- monitoring, backup/restore and disaster-recovery evidence;
- provider retry/dead-letter/idempotency evidence.

## Safety rules

- no schema migration;
- no production database operation;
- no real detainee data;
- no production credentials or secrets;
- AI remains OFF;
- synthetic fixtures/test doubles only;
- certification remains fail-closed.

## Governance boundary

P10.41–P10.44 prepare the controlled path after an authorized governance decision. No code path may infer approval, lift the freeze, execute migrations, enable AI, or activate external providers automatically. Until an authorized decision and independently verifiable execution evidence exist, the database remains untouched and production activation remains blocked.
