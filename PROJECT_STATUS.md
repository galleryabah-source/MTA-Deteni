# MTA DETENI — Project Status

**Version:** Foundation v1.15
**Current Phase:** P10.809–P10.904 application-surface and release-readiness hardening
**Implementation Track:** P10.904
**Branch:** `main`

## Latest Progress

- P10.681–P10.704 synthetic E2E orchestration;
- P10.705–P10.728 UI/operator read-model contract;
- P10.729–P10.752 deterministic report-renderer preparation;
- P10.753–P10.776 regression/security hardening baseline;
- P10.777–P10.808 application-surface implementation boundary;
- P10.809–P10.840 application-surface composition and synthetic regression;
- P10.841–P10.872 responsive operator workflow UI contract;
- P10.873–P10.904 release-readiness boundary.

## Integrated Application Model

RAP owns registration, administration and reporting; PERKES owns health records and health workflows; KAMTIB owns placement, movement, headcount, temporary exit, escort and operational QR; SUBBAG TU owns escort assignment/document administration; HEAD RUDENIM has oversight, read-only operational visibility and authority for petunjuk, arahan, rekomendasi and disposisi without direct operational editing.

## Safety / Governance

- Migration Freeze: **TRUE**;
- AI: **OFF**;
- Repository data: **SYNTHETIC ONLY**;
- Production access: **NOT AUTHORIZED**;
- Live PostgreSQL execution: **BLOCKED until explicit governance clearance and an approved non-production target**;
- No real detainee data, credentials, health records, WhatsApp exports or production PII in GitHub;
- No autonomous AI decision-making;
- No direct WhatsApp/OCR/transcript → approved operational record;
- No schema migration before approved data model, security controls, reconciliation and governance gate.

## Current Gate

**P10.904 — RELEASE-CANDIDATE CONTRACT READY / EXECUTION EVIDENCE REQUIRED**

The application surface now has explicit UI/read-model, QR, reporting and operator-workflow boundaries. Release readiness remains evidence-based; no CI PASS, live database PASS, or production readiness is claimed without observable evidence.

## Next Gate

**P10.905–936 — synthetic release-candidate test matrix, evidence packet composition, and final pre-authorisation audit of application boundaries.**
